# Concurrent Document Editor
## Project Overview
### Deliverables
Our goal is to create a server-client system that:
* serves simple text documents over HTTP
* allows a user to create a new text document with an HTTP request
* accepts updates to a document over HTTP
* stores and maintains revision history for a document
* allows multiple editors to work on the same document concurrently
* uses [Operational Transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation) to incorporate changes from multiple users into a single, newest version of the document
    * resolving conflicts as necessary

### Acceptance Criteria
At least initially, we can use a REST client (e.g. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)) to test our sytem. Once we have the central pieces in place, we can create a JavaScript client with a GUI to perform all the edition operations.

#### Single User Use Case
- [ ] retrieve the latest version of a document with an `HTTP GET` request
- [ ] send updates for a specific document with an `HTTP POST` request
- [ ] confirm that the changes took effect by repeating the first step

#### Multi-User Use Case
The multi-user case can be "simulated" from a single machine:
- [ ] retrieve the latest version of a document **R1** with an `HTTP GET` request
- [ ] send an update **U1** with an `HTTP POST` request, identifying **R1** as the working copy
    - the latest version of the document on the server should now be **R2**
- [ ] send another update **U2** with an `HTTP POST` request, *also identifying **R1** as the working copy*
- [ ] confirm that the server applied **U2** on top of **R2**, even though we sent the update while working on **R1**

### Stretch Goals
#### Client-Side
##### Editing GUI
* support a basic document editing environment in the browser

##### Real-time Edition
* allow real-time edition of documents so that users see each other's editions as they happen
    * this would likely require that we iterate on our architecture (e.g. use web sockets instead of simple HTTP)

##### Undo
Maintain undo stack on client-side.
* simpler case: client undoes **unsaved** changes only
* complex case: client may undo **saved** changes also

##### Redo
Implies that stack frames aren't erased when popped.
